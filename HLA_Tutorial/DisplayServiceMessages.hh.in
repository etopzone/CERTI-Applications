HLA Tutorial\n\n\
This tutorial gives a brief introduction in the usage of the High Level \
Architecture Interface Specification 1.3. HLA is a standard for distributed \
computer simulation systems. The middleware implementing HLA is called Runtime \
Infrastructure (RTI).\n\
The API is separated in so called RTI ambassador services and federate \
ambassador services. The RTI ambassador services are provided by an \
RTIambassador object and are handled like normal method invocations. In \
contrast, federate ambassador services have to be implemented within the \
federate and can be regarded as a callback mechanism.\n\
Furthermore the services are divided in different management areas. This \
tutorial shows and explains the correct usage of essential API calls of \
the management areas Federation Management, Declaration Management and \
Object Management.\

/* Federation Management - RTI services */

#define DS_MSG_FEDERATION_MANAGEMENT "\
Federation Management\n\n\
Services of this management area coordinate federation-wide activities \
such as creating or destroying federations and joining or resigning a \
federation. Federation-wide save and restore activities and synchronization \
operations are also supported. \
    "

#define DS_MSG_CREATE_FEDERATION_EXECUTION "\
Federation Management -> Create Federation Execution\n\n\
The RTI ambassador service createFederationExecution is usally invoked by the \
first federate. This service creates the federation specified by a name and a \
file holding the federation object model (FOM). \
    "
    
#define DS_MSG_CREATE_FEDERATION_EXECUTION_SRC "@DS_MSG_CREATE_FEDERATION_EXECUTION_SRC@"

#define DS_MSG_JOIN_FEDERATION_EXECUTION "\
Federation Management -> Join Federation Execution\n\n\
The RTI ambassador service joinFederationExecution is used by a federate to \
join an existing federation. Input parameters are its own name, the federation \
name of the federation it wants to join and a pointer to its federate \
ambassador implementation. \
    "

#define DS_MSG_JOIN_FEDERATION_EXECUTION_SRC "@DS_MSG_JOIN_FEDERATION_EXECUTION_SRC@"

#define DS_MSG_RESIGN_FEDERATION_EXECUTION "\
Federation Management -> Resign Federation Execution\n\n\
The RTI ambassador service resignFederationExecution is used by a federate \
when leaving the federation. The required ResignAction parameter resolves \
ownership of any attributes owned by the federate. Allowed values are: \
RELEASE_ATTRIBUTES, DELETE_OBJECT, \
DELETE_OBJECTS_AND_RELEASE_ATTRIBUTES (common practice), NO_ACTION. \

#define DS_MSG_DESTROY_FEDERATION_EXECUTION "\
Federation Management -> Destroy Federation Execution\n\n\
The RTI ambassador service destroyFederationExecution is usally invoked \
by the last federate. This service destroys the current federation \
execution. \

/* Declaration Management - RTI services */

#define DS_MSG_DECLARATION_MANAGEMENT "\
Declaration Management\n\n \
HLA communication relies on an implicit data exchange mechanism. That's why \
federates have to declare their intention to generate or receive information \
in their initialization phase according to their FOM resp. their SOM. \
Declaration Management can also be regarded as interest management. \
    "

#define DS_MSG_PUBLISH_OBJECT_CLASS "\
Declaration Management -> Publish Object Class\n\n \
When invoking this service the federate announces that it can produce \
information for the specified attributes within the AttributeHandleSet class \
in its future execution. \

#define DS_MSG_PUBLISH_OBJECT_CLASS_SRC "@DS_MSG_PUBLISH_OBJECT_CLASS_SRC@"

#define DS_MSG_SUBSCRIBE_TO_OBJECT_CLASS "\

receiving updates for the specified attributes within the AttributeHandleSet \
class in its future execution. \

/* Object Management - RTI services */

#define DS_MSG_OBJECT_MANAGEMENT "\
Object Management\n\n \
This part of the interface specification deals with deletion, instantiation, \
modification and registration of object instances. The necessary data exchange \
mechanisms, especially updating and reflecting attributes and sending and \
receiving interactions are part of this management area. \
    "

#define DS_MSG_REGISTER_OBJECT_INSTANCE "\
Object Management -> Register Object Instance\n\n \
This service creates a new object instance. Other federates are informed \
through the federate service discoverObjectInstance. \
    "

#define DS_MSG_REGISTER_OBJECT_INSTANCE_SRC "@DS_MSG_REGISTER_OBJECT_INSTANCE_SRC@"

#define DS_MSG_UPDATE_ATTRIBUTE_VALUES "\
Object Management -> Update Attribute Values\n\n \
The federate informs interested federates about object updates. Interested \
federates will receive the updates by a reflectAttributeValues callback. \

/* Object Management - Federate services */

#define DS_MSG_DISCOVER_OBJECT_INSTANCE "\
Object Management -> Discover Object Instance\n\n \
This federate service informs the federate of a new object instance. Federates \
are only informed about new objects if they have specified their interests in \
a former subscription invocation. In this case, we are informed about a new \
instance of the output variable y. \
    "

#define DS_MSG_DISCOVER_OBJECT_INSTANCE_SRC "@DS_MSG_DISCOVER_OBJECT_INSTANCE_SRC@"

#define DS_MSG_REFLECT_ATTRIBUTE_VALUES "\
Object Management -> Reflect Attribute Values\n\n \
This federate service informs the federate of new state updates for attributes \
it is currently interesting in. \

/* Ancillary Services */

#define DS_MSG_GET_OBJECT_CLASS_HANDLE "\

This service returns a numeric handle for the named object class \
according to the FOM resp. SOM. \

#define DS_MSG_GET_ATTRIBUTE_HANDLE "\
Ancillary Service -> Get Attribute Handle\n\n \
This service returns a numeric handle for the named attribute according to \
the FOM resp. SOM. The numeric handle of the corresponding object class have to\
be specified as second input parameter. \
